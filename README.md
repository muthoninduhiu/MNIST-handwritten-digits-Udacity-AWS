# Handwritten Digit Recognition using PyTorch
## Overview
In this project, we implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The goal was to achieve high accuracy in classifying the digits (0-9) present in the images.

## Dataset
We used the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits along with their corresponding labels. The dataset was divided into training, validation, and test sets.

## Model Architecture
We designed a CNN architecture consisting of convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers, and dropout layers to prevent overfitting. The final layer used softmax activation to output probabilities for each digit class.

## Training
The model was trained using the training set and validated using the validation set. We used the Adam optimizer with cross-entropy loss as the loss function. The training process involved iterating over multiple epochs, adjusting hyperparameters, and monitoring performance.

## Evaluation
After training, the model was evaluated using the test set to assess its accuracy and loss on unseen data. The evaluation metrics provided insights into the model's performance and generalization ability.

## Results
The trained model achieved a test accuracy of approximately 97%, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing handwritten digits. We compared our results with benchmark performances and discussed the implications.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, we successfully implemented a CNN-based digit recognition system using PyTorch. The project showcased the power of deep learning in solving classification tasks and provided a foundation for further research and applications in image recognition.
